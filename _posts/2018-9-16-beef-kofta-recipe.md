## INGREDIENTS

  * 500g British beef mince (see tip)
  * Large handful of fresh parsley, finely chopped
  * 2 garlic cloves, crushed
  * 2 tsp ground coriander
  * 2 tsp ground cumin
  * 200g couscous
  * 2 tbsp olive oil, plus extra to drizzle
  * 1-2 tsp harissa to taste
  * Large handful of fresh coriander leaves, chopped
  * Greek yogurt to serve

## METHOD

  1. Mix the mince with half the parsley, the garlic, ground coriander and cumin, then season generously. Roll into 12 sausage shapes, cover and chill. Put the couscous in a bowl, pour over boiling water to just cover (about 300ml), season generously and cover with cling film. Leave for 5-10 minutes, then fluff with a fork and add a drizzle of olive oil.
  2. Meanwhile, heat the 2 tbsp oil in a large frying pan. When hot, cook the koftas, turning occasionally, for 6-7 minutes, until crisp and cooked through. Remove to kitchen paper.
  3. Stir the harissa into the couscous, then add the remaining parsley and the coriander and check the seasoning. Serve the koftas on the couscous with a dollop of Greek yogurt.

  * Don't use lean mince for this recipe - a bit of fat keeps the koftas moist.
  * Double up and freeze: Wrap the uncooked koftas in cling film, freeze for 3 months, then defrost before frying.
